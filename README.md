# Tidal-Deformation-of-Neutron-Stars
Bachelor thesis, University of Trento

An important prediction of general relativity is the emission of gravitational waves, which are ripples in the curvature of space-time. The first detection of gravitational waves was made by the LIGO Collaboration in September 2015.


Nowadays, tens of detections have been reported and some of them are from the inspiral phase of Binary Neutron Star Systems (which are binary systems made up of two neutron stars).


These detections had a profound impact in our understanding of gravity and the physics of dense matter under extreme conditions. We can indeed use the data from inspiral phase of binary neutron stars mergers to infer the tidal deformability of the stars setting stringent
constraints on their equation of state.


The aim of this thesis is to study the main aspects of neutron stars and binary neutron star systems, focusing in particular on the tidal effects described through the Love number k2 which is the object of our computational calculation.


The code NS_code, written in C language, takes in input the Equation of State of a Neutron Star and compute the sequence of Mass, Cenral Pressure, Radius and Love Number $k_2$.
